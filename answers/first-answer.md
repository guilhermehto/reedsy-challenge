## Node.js projects

### PrecifyIt
I only have one Node.js project which is a simple web crawler called PrecifyIt. It was implemented using [Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest), [Puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer) and [Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/). Its purpose is to collect price information of eletronic products on several brazilian ecommerces. The routine would be triggered from time to time and all the prices are stored in a NoSql database. 
The next step would be to create an admin panel to present all that information in a readable way, but I didn't actually got to it because new projects got in the way.
Funny history about this project, it was under development before 2017's Black Friday and by monitoring the prices I could see a bunch of cell phones increasing dramatically in price a few weeks before the sales.

### Others
Besides PrecifyIt, I have also used Node.js when I had to develop a few [Firebase Functions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/) for an app that I was developing for a client. 

## AngularJS
As stated before, I don't actually have any projects with AngularJS. When I got my hands on Angular it was already of version 2, so I jumped straight to it. I do have a good amount of experience with Angular, though. But I do believe that they aren't that different from each other and with a few days working with AngularJS I'll  get the hang of it pretty quickly.
